title: Remove Recently Edited and Favorites from Dashboard
area: ui
files:
  - src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx
---

## Problem

The Dashboard currently shows "Recently Edited" and "Favorites" cards that are no longer needed. User wants these removed to simplify the dashboard interface.

## Solution

Remove the RecentlyEdited and Favorites components from the Dashboard layout. The dashboard will focus on Stats, Activity feed, and Today's Meetings.
