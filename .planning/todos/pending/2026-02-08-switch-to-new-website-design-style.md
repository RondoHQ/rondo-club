title: Switch to new website design style
area: ui

## Problem

The Rondo Club app UI currently uses its own design language. A new design style has been established for the website (developer.rondo.club or rondo.club) and the app should be updated to match this new visual style for consistency across the brand.

## Solution

TBD — Need to identify what the new website style entails (colors, typography, spacing, component patterns, etc.) and systematically apply it across the React SPA. This likely involves updating Tailwind config, component styles, and possibly layout patterns.
