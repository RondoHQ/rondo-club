title: Add import from Twenty CRM

## Problem

Twenty CRM is an open-source CRM platform. Users who want to migrate from Twenty CRM to Stadion currently have no automated way to import their contacts and organizations.

Similar to the existing Monica CRM import functionality (`STADION_Monica_Import`), there should be an import tool for Twenty CRM data.

## Solution

TBD - needs investigation of Twenty CRM's export format (likely JSON or CSV) and mapping to Stadion data model (Person, Organization, Important Dates, relationships).
