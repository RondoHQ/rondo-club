## Problem

The React frontend has grown significantly over 60 phases of development. While individual features work correctly, there has been no systematic performance review using established React best practices.

Areas that may benefit from optimization:
- Component render cycles and memoization
- Bundle size and code splitting
- Data fetching patterns and waterfalls
- State management efficiency

## Solution

Use the `react-best-practices` skill which provides 40+ rules for:
- Eliminating data fetching waterfalls
- Optimizing bundles
- Improving rendering performance

Run comprehensive analysis and create actionable improvement plan.
