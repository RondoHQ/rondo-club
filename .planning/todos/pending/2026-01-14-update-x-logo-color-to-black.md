title: Update X logo color to black

## Problem

The X (formerly Twitter) logo/icon is still using the old Twitter blue color. Since the rebrand to X, the logo should be black.

## Solution

Update the X icon color from Twitter blue (#1DA1F2) to black (#000000) wherever it appears in the contact details display.
