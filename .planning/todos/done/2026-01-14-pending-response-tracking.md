title: Add pending response tracking
area: ui

## Problem

To-dos and activities in Caelis can lead to emails or messages being sent (e.g., reaching out to a contact, sending a follow-up). Currently there's no easy way to track which outreach is still awaiting a response from the other party.

Users need visibility into:
- Which contacts they're waiting to hear back from
- How long they've been waiting
- What the original outreach was about

Without this, users must manually remember or use external tools to track pending responses.

## Solution

Add a "pending response" feature that:
- Allows marking an activity/todo as "awaiting response"
- Shows a dedicated view/filter for pending responses
- Optionally tracks time since outreach
- Auto-clears when a new activity is logged for that contact

TBD: Exact UI placement (dashboard widget, filter on activities, separate section)
