title: Show counts in widget headings
area: ui
files:
  - src/pages/Dashboard.jsx
  - src/components/widgets/
---

## Problem

The dashboard widgets (People, Organizations, Events, Todos) show their content but the headings don't indicate the total count of items. Adding counts to the widget headings would give users a quick overview of their data at a glance.

Example desired format:
- People (42)
- Organizations (15)
- Events (8)
- Todos (3)

## Solution

TBD - Add count to each widget's heading, likely using data already fetched or from dashboard endpoint.
