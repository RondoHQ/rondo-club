## Problem

The person detail page header doesn't display the person's current role and job/team. This key information should be visible immediately when viewing a contact, rather than requiring users to scroll to find employment details.

## Solution

Update the PersonDetail header section to display:
- Current job title/role
- Current team (linked)

TBD: Layout/styling decisions for header area
