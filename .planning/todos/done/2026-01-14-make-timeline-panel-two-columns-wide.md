title: Make Timeline panel 2 columns wide on desktop
area: ui
files:
  - src/pages/PersonDetail.jsx
---

## Problem

The Timeline panel on the person profile is currently single column width. On desktop screens, this leaves unused horizontal space and makes the timeline content feel cramped.

## Solution

Update the Timeline panel layout to span 2 columns on desktop viewports. This will give timeline entries more room and better utilize available screen space.

TBD: Determine breakpoint for 2-column behavior and how it interacts with the sidebar.
