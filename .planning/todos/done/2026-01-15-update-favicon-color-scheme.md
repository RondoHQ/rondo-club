title: Update favicon to match current color scheme

## Problem

The app's favicon doesn't match the current color scheme. With the recent theme customization features (v3.8), the favicon should be updated to align with the app's visual identity.

## Solution

TBD - Create/update favicon to match the current accent colors and branding:
1. Design favicon using the app's primary/accent colors
2. Generate multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, apple-touch-icon, etc.)
3. Consider whether favicon should adapt to user's color scheme choice or use a fixed brand color
