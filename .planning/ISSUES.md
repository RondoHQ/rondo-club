# Project Issues Log

Enhancements discovered during execution. Not critical - address in future phases.

## Open Enhancements

### ISS-001: Add sorting by Organization and Workspace in list view

- **Discovered:** Phase 13 Task 3 checkpoint (2026-01-13)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** Currently can only sort by Name, Created, and Last Modified. Users want to sort by Organization column (company name) and Workspace column (assigned workspaces) for better list organization.
- **Impact:** Low (works correctly, this would enhance usability)
- **Effort:** Medium (need to add sorting logic for Organization which requires lookup, Workspace sorting needs multi-value handling)
- **Suggested phase:** Future

### ISS-002: Add Label column to list view with sorting

- **Discovered:** Post Phase 13 completion (2026-01-13)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** Add a Labels column to the list view showing person_label taxonomy terms. Enable sorting by label for grouping contacts by classification.
- **Impact:** Low (works correctly, this would enhance usability)
- **Effort:** Medium (need to display multiple labels in column, sorting by multi-value field)
- **Suggested phase:** Future
