## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Season key format YYYY-YYYY already established (v12.0)
- Per-season fee amounts already stored in WordPress options (`rondo_membership_fees_{season}`)
- Season detection (July 1 boundary) and next-season support already implemented
- Forecast mode already works for next season
- User chose: WordPress options storage, copy-previous for new seasons, fully configurable age ranges

### Pending Todos

3 todo(s) in `.planning/todos/pending/`:
- **public-vog-upload-and-validation**: Public VOG Upload and Validation (area: api)
- **soft-delete-inactive-members**: Soft-delete inactive members instead of hard delete (area: data-model)
- **store-sync-field-mappings-in-json**: Store Sportlink sync field mappings in ACF JSON (area: data-model)

### Blockers/Concerns

- v20.0 Configurable Roles (phases 151-154) not yet executed — v21.0 phases 155-159 depend on v20.0 completing first
