Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Milestone v19.0 complete

Progress: Ready for /gsd:new-milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions from v19.0:
- **Store birthdate directly on person records** - Not as Important Date CPT, simpler data model
- **Display format: age + birthdate** - "43 jaar (6 feb 1982)" includes full birth year for clarity
- **Delete production data before code removal** - Data must be deleted while CPT is still registered
- **is_deceased always returns false** - Death date feature removed with Important Dates
- **Version 19.0.0 major release** - Removing Important Dates is a breaking change

### Pending Todos

3 todo(s) in `.planning/todos/pending/`:
- **public-vog-upload-and-validation**: Public VOG Upload and Validation (area: api)
- **soft-delete-inactive-members**: Soft-delete inactive members instead of hard delete (area: data-model)
- **store-sync-field-mappings-in-json**: Store Sportlink sync field mappings in ACF JSON (area: data-model)
