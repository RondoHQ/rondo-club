## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- **CLUB-CONFIG-IN-OPTIONS** (2026-02-05): Club-wide settings (name, default color, FreeScout URL) stored in WordPress options, manageable via Settings page
- **RENAME-AWC-TO-CLUB** (2026-02-05): Rename 'awc' accent color key to 'club' throughout codebase for reusability
- v17.0 planning: Backend configuration system must come before frontend to provide API
- v17.0 planning: Color rename (awc→club) combined with Settings UI (both frontend, non-conflicting)
