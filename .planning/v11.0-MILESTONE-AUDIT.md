## Tech Debt & Deferred Items

No tech debt accumulated during this milestone.

**Observations:**
- ACF fields `datum-vog` and `vog-email-verzonden` are managed via Sportlink sync (not in acf-json/)
- This is by design, not tech debt

## Gaps Summary

### Critical Gaps (Blockers)
None identified.

### Non-Critical Gaps (Tech Debt)
None identified.

### Human Verification Pending
Phase 121 has 1 item requiring human visual verification:
- Confirmation modal display before bulk actions

This is non-blocking — code exists and is wired correctly.
