# Plan 38-01: Quick UI Fixes

## Overview

Fix two minor UI consistency issues: update X (formerly Twitter) logo color from old Twitter blue to black, and fix missing rounded corners on AwaitingTodoCard in the dashboard.

## Why These Changes

1. **X Logo Color**: X's brand color is black, not the old Twitter blue (#1DA1F2). The current color is outdated since Twitter rebranded to X.

2. **Dashboard Card Styling**: The `AwaitingTodoCard` component is missing the `rounded-lg` class that all other dashboard cards have, causing visual inconsistency.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update X Logo Color to Black

**File:** `src/pages/People/PersonDetail.jsx`
**Location:** Line 1231 in `getSocialIconColor` function

**Change:**
```javascript
// Before
case 'twitter': return 'text-[#1DA1F2]';

// After
case 'twitter': return 'text-[#000000]';
```

**Testing:**
- View a person profile with a Twitter/X social link
- Verify the X icon appears in black instead of blue

### Task 2: Fix AwaitingTodoCard Rounded Corners

**File:** `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
**Location:** Line 191 in `AwaitingTodoCard` function

**Change:**
```javascript
// Before
className="flex items-start p-3 hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors"

// After
className="flex items-start p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors"
```

**Testing:**
- View the dashboard with awaiting todos
- Verify the awaiting todo cards have rounded corners matching other cards

## Verification

1. Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors
2. Test both changes visually in the browser:
   - X logo appears black on person profiles
   - Awaiting todo cards have consistent rounded styling
