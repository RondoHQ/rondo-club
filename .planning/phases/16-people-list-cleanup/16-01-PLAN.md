<objective>
Clean up People list view by removing card view and adding dedicated image column.

Purpose: Simplify the UI by removing the redundant card view and fix the column alignment issue where the "First Name" header doesn't align with actual first names (because the image is embedded in that column).
Output: List-only view with proper image column, cleaner code with card components removed.

**Key source file:**
@src/pages/People/PeopleList.jsx

**Issues being addressed:**
- ISS-006: Remove card view from People, use list view only
- ISS-007: Move person image to its own column without header label

**Prior phase context:**
- Phase 14-02 established SortableHeader component pattern
- Phase 14-02 established scrollable table container with sticky thead
- List view is fully functional with sorting, selection, and bulk actions

**What exists now:**
- `PersonCard` component (lines 32-84) - to be removed
- `viewMode` state with localStorage persistence (line 685-687) - to be removed
- View mode toggle UI (lines 1092-1108) - to be removed
- Card view rendering (lines 1409-1420) - to be removed
- Image embedded in First Name column (lines 113-127 in PersonListRow) - to be moved

**Target state:**
- List view is the only view
- New narrow image column (no header label, ~40px wide) before First Name
- First Name column shows only the name (no image)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add dedicated image column to list view</name>
  <files>src/pages/People/PeopleList.jsx</files>
  <action>
Modify PersonListRow and PersonListView to add a dedicated image column:

1. In `PersonListRow`:
   - Add new `<td>` after the checkbox column for the image (before First Name)
   - Move the image rendering (thumbnail or initial placeholder) to this new cell
   - Style: `w-10 px-2` for narrow column, vertically centered
   - Remove the image from the First Name `<td>` - keep only the name text

2. In `PersonListView` table header:
   - Add empty `<th>` after checkbox header for image column
   - Style: `w-10 px-2 bg-gray-50` (no label text, just empty header)
   - This ensures "First Name" header aligns with actual first names

3. Verify the star icon stays with the first name (not in image column)

Do NOT remove card view components yet - that's Task 2.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes, npm run lint passes</verify>
  <done>Image has dedicated column, First Name header aligns with first name values, star icon visible next to names</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove card view and simplify to list-only</name>
  <files>src/pages/People/PeopleList.jsx</files>
  <action>
Remove all card view related code:

1. Delete the `PersonCard` component function (lines ~32-84)

2. Remove view mode state and persistence:
   - Delete `viewMode` useState (localStorage-backed)
   - Delete the useEffect that persists viewMode to localStorage
   - Remove `LayoutGrid`, `List` from lucide-react imports (only if unused elsewhere)

3. Remove view mode toggle UI:
   - Delete the view mode toggle buttons div (LayoutGrid/List icons)

4. Remove card view rendering:
   - Delete the conditional card grid rendering block
   - Keep only the list view rendering (PersonListView component)

5. Clean up:
   - Remove any unused variables/imports after deletions
   - The selection toolbar and bulk actions remain (they're list-view only features anyway)

IMPORTANT: Keep all list view functionality intact - sorting, selection, bulk actions, filters.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes, npm run lint --max-warnings 0 passes</verify>
  <done>PersonCard component removed, viewMode state removed, view toggle UI removed, only list view remains, all list functionality works</done>

  <what-built>People list view with dedicated image column and card view removed</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:5173/people (or production URL)
    3. Verify: List view displays automatically (no toggle buttons)
    4. Verify: Image column shows photos/initials in narrow column before First Name
    5. Verify: "First Name" header aligns directly above first name values (no image offset)
    6. Verify: Star icon appears next to names (for favorites)
    7. Verify: Sorting by clicking headers still works
    8. Verify: Selection checkboxes and bulk actions still work
    9. Verify: Filters still work
