  <name>Task 1: Version bump, changelog, and commit fixture</name>
  <files>

    style.css
    package.json
    CHANGELOG.md
  </files>
  <action>
1. **Bump version to 24.0.0** in both files:
   - `style.css`: Update `Version: 23.2.1` to `Version: 24.0.0`
   - `package.json`: Update `"version": "23.2.1"` to `"version": "24.0.0"`

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with v24.0 entry under `[Unreleased]`:
   Replace `## [Unreleased]` with:
   ```markdown
   ## [Unreleased]

   ## [24.0.0] - 2026-02-11

   ### Added
   - WP-CLI `wp rondo demo export` command to create anonymized fixture files from production data
   - WP-CLI `wp rondo demo import` command to load fixture into any WordPress instance
   - WP-CLI `wp rondo demo import --clean` flag to wipe existing data before import
   - Dutch fake data generator (names with infixes, addresses, phone numbers, emails)
   - Date-shifting on import so demo data always looks current
   - Data anonymization: fake names, emails, phones, addresses replace real PII
   - Weighted fake financial amounts (Nikki data) for realistic fee patterns
   - Season-aware date shifting for fee configs and discipline case seasons
   - Committed demo fixture file (`fixtures/demo-fixture.json`) for portable demo environments

   ### Removed
   - All photos and avatars stripped from demo fixture (photos are identity, not anonymizable)
   ```

3. **Remove the example fixture** since the real fixture supersedes it:
   - Delete `fixtures/demo-fixture.example.json`
   - Also delete `docs/demo-fixture-schema.md` if it was created during planning (check if it exists)

4. **Commit everything**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/joostdevalk/Code/rondo/rondo-club
   git add fixtures/demo-fixture.json style.css package.json CHANGELOG.md
   git rm fixtures/demo-fixture.example.json 2>/dev/null || true
   git rm docs/demo-fixture-schema.md 2>/dev/null || true
   git commit -m "feat(v24.0): ship Demo Data milestone with committed fixture"
   git push
   ```

5. **Tag the release**:
   ```bash
   git tag v24.0
   git push origin v24.0
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>
- `git log --oneline -1` shows the commit
- `git tag -l v24.0` shows the tag
- `fixtures/demo-fixture.json` is tracked in git
- Version is 24.0.0 in both style.css and package.json
- CHANGELOG.md has v24.0.0 entry

   - Move v24.0 requirements from Active to Validated section
   - Mark all EXPORT-*, IMP-*, FIX-* requirements as completed

4. **Update developer docs** if the demo data system is documented:
   - Check if `../developer/src/content/docs/` has relevant integration docs
   - If not, create a brief doc at `../developer/src/content/docs/integrations/demo-data.md` documenting:
     - Export command usage
     - Import command usage (with --clean flag)
     - Fixture format overview
     - Date-shifting behavior

5. **Commit planning docs**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/joostdevalk/Code/rondo/rondo-club
   git add -A .planning/
   git commit -m "docs(174): complete v24.0 Demo Data milestone"
   git push
