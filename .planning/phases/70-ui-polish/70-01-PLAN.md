<objective>
Soften the delete button styling on PersonDetail and TeamDetail pages from aggressive solid red to a gentler outline style.

Purpose: The current solid red delete button draws too much visual attention for a secondary action and feels aggressive. An outlined style de-emphasizes the button while keeping it clearly identifiable as a destructive action.

Output: Updated CSS class and modified components with softer delete button styling.

Relevant files:
- src/index.css (contains btn-danger and other button classes)
- src/pages/People/PersonDetail.jsx (line 1401: delete button)
- src/pages/Teams/TeamDetail.jsx (line 245: delete button)

Note: UserApproval.jsx also uses btn-danger but should keep the solid style for critical admin actions.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add btn-danger-outline class to CSS</name>
  <files>src/index.css</files>
  <action>
Add a new `btn-danger-outline` class after the existing `btn-danger` class (around line 200). The new class should:

1. Use the base `btn` class for shared button styles
2. Use transparent background (not solid red)
3. Add red border: `border border-red-500`
4. Use red text: `text-red-500`
5. Add hover state that fills with subtle red: `hover:bg-red-50 hover:text-red-600`
6. Keep focus ring: `focus:ring-red-500`
7. Add dark mode support:
   - `dark:border-red-400 dark:text-red-400`
   - `dark:hover:bg-red-900/30 dark:hover:text-red-300`

The class definition should follow the existing pattern in the file (using @apply with Tailwind classes).

Example:
```css
.btn-danger-outline {
  @apply btn bg-transparent text-red-500 border border-red-500 hover:bg-red-50 hover:text-red-600 focus:ring-red-500 dark:text-red-400 dark:border-red-400 dark:hover:bg-red-900/30 dark:hover:text-red-300;
}
```
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` to confirm CSS compiles without errors. Grep index.css for "btn-danger-outline" to confirm class exists.</verify>
  <done>The btn-danger-outline class exists in index.css with outlined styling, hover states, and dark mode support.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update delete buttons in PersonDetail and TeamDetail</name>
  <files>src/pages/People/PersonDetail.jsx, src/pages/Teams/TeamDetail.jsx</files>
  <action>
Update both files to use the new `btn-danger-outline` class instead of `btn-danger`:

1. In `src/pages/People/PersonDetail.jsx` around line 1401:
   Change `className="btn-danger"` to `className="btn-danger-outline"`

2. In `src/pages/Teams/TeamDetail.jsx` around line 245:
   Change `className="btn-danger"` to `className="btn-danger-outline"`

Do NOT change the delete buttons in UserApproval.jsx - those should remain solid red for critical admin actions.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run lint` to confirm no linting errors.
Run `npm run build` to confirm production build succeeds.
Grep both files for "btn-danger-outline" to confirm changes applied.
  </verify>
  <done>Both PersonDetail.jsx and TeamDetail.jsx delete buttons use btn-danger-outline class.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run lint` passes with no errors
2. `npm run build` completes successfully
3. Visual verification: Delete button on person detail page shows as outlined red (border + text red, no solid background)
4. Visual verification: Hover state shows subtle red fill
5. Visual verification: Dark mode shows appropriate colors
6. UserApproval.jsx delete buttons remain solid red (unchanged)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Delete button on PersonDetail and TeamDetail pages displays as outlined style (red border, red text, transparent background)
- Hover state fills with subtle red background
- Both light and dark mode render correctly
- No build or lint errors
- btn-danger class remains unchanged for other use cases
</success_criteria>
