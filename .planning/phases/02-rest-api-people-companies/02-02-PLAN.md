<objective>
Extract company-related REST API endpoints and methods into a dedicated STADION_REST_Companies class.

Purpose: Complete Phase 2 by moving company domain logic out of the monolithic class.
Output: New `class-rest-companies.php` with company endpoints, `class-rest-api.php` further reduced.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create STADION_REST_Companies class with routes and methods</name>
  <files>includes/class-rest-companies.php</files>
  <action>
Create new file `includes/class-rest-companies.php` with class STADION_REST_Companies extending STADION_REST_Base.

In constructor:
- Add `rest_api_init` action to register_routes method

Register these routes in register_routes():
- `/companies/{company_id}/people` - GET - callback: get_people_by_company, permission: __return_true (public endpoint per existing code)
- `/companies/{company_id}/logo` - POST - callback: set_company_logo, permission: check_company_edit_permission
- `/companies/{company_id}/logo/upload` - POST - callback: upload_company_logo, permission: check_company_edit_permission

Copy these methods from class-rest-api.php:
- get_people_by_company (lines ~481-568) - note: this checks access internally via STADION_Access_Control
- set_company_logo (lines ~1546-1575)
- upload_company_logo (lines ~1653-1720)

Use protected methods from base class: format_person_summary (used in get_people_by_company).
Permission methods are public in base class and can be used as permission_callback via $this.
  </action>
  <verify>php -l includes/class-rest-companies.php shows no syntax errors</verify>
  <done>class-rest-companies.php exists with STADION_REST_Companies class containing all company-specific endpoints</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove company methods from STADION_REST_API and update autoloader</name>
  <files>includes/class-rest-api.php, functions.php</files>
  <action>
Remove from class-rest-api.php:

From register_routes():
- Remove route registration for `/companies/{company_id}/people`
- Remove route registration for `/companies/{company_id}/logo`
- Remove route registration for `/companies/{company_id}/logo/upload`

Remove these methods entirely:
- get_people_by_company
- set_company_logo
- upload_company_logo

In functions.php:

1. Add autoloader mapping for STADION_REST_Companies:
   'STADION_REST_Companies' => 'includes/class-rest-companies.php'
   (Add near the STADION_REST_People mapping)

2. Instantiate the new class in stadion_init() function:
   new STADION_REST_Companies();
   (Add after the STADION_REST_People instantiation)
  </action>
  <verify>php -l includes/class-rest-api.php passes AND php -l functions.php passes</verify>
  <done>class-rest-api.php no longer contains company-specific routes or methods, autoloader updated</done>
</task>

- [ ] `php -l includes/class-rest-api.php` passes
- [ ] `php -l functions.php` passes
- [ ] class-rest-companies.php contains all 3 company-related methods
