<objective>
Fix stale "important dates" references in documentation after v19.0 removed that system.

Purpose: Documentation should reflect the current birthdate model where birthdates are stored directly on person records, not as Important Date CPT entries.
Output: Updated documentation files with accurate references.
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update CardDAV, API, and iCal documentation</name>
  <files>docs/carddav.md, docs/api-leden-crud.md, docs/ical-feed.md</files>
  <action>
Update docs/carddav.md:
- Line 110: Change `Birthday (from important dates)` to `Birthday (from person record)`

Update docs/api-leden-crud.md:
- Lines 203-204: Change `birth_year` description from "derived from birthday important date" to "Birth year (derived from birthdate field)"
- The `birth_year` field is still computed in `includes/class-rest-people.php` lines 627-634

Update docs/ical-feed.md:
- Line 3: Change "subscribe to their important dates" to "subscribe to birthdays"
  </action>
  <verify>
grep -i "important date" docs/carddav.md docs/api-leden-crud.md docs/ical-feed.md - should return no matches
  </verify>
  <done>CardDAV, API, and iCal docs reference birthdate on person record, not Important Dates CPT</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update frontend architecture and multi-user documentation</name>
  <files>docs/frontend-architecture.md, docs/multi-user.md</files>
  <action>
Update docs/frontend-architecture.md:
- Line 33-34: Remove `Dates/` from directory structure listing (it was removed in Phase 148)
- Lines 89-92: Remove the `/dates` routes from the Route Structure table:
  - `/dates` | `DatesList` | Important dates list
  - `/dates/new` | `DateForm` | Create date
  - `/dates/:id/edit` | `DateForm` | Edit date

Update docs/multi-user.md:
- Lines 99-100: Change "Upcoming important dates" to "Upcoming birthdays" in the Daily Digest section
  </action>
  <verify>
grep -i "important date" docs/frontend-architecture.md docs/multi-user.md - should return no matches
grep "/dates" docs/frontend-architecture.md - should return no matches
  </verify>
  <done>Frontend architecture reflects removed Dates pages, multi-user doc references birthdays not important dates</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. `grep -ri "important date" docs/` - Should return no matches
2. `grep "/dates" docs/frontend-architecture.md` - Should return no matches
3. All 5 documentation files are updated and committed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- No documentation file references "important dates" as a feature or data source
- No documentation references the removed `/dates` route
- Birthday/birthdate references accurately point to person.birthdate field
- Version bump to v19.0.1 (patch for documentation fix)
- Changes committed and deployed
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/150-update-documentation/150-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
