<objective>
Make fee calculations correctly handle former members: include them if they were active during the season (lid-sinds in current season), charge full season fee with no pro-rata discount, and exclude them if they joined after the season started.

Purpose: Complete the v23.0 Former Members milestone by ensuring the contributie system properly accounts for members who left during the season.
Output: Updated fee calculation engine, REST API fee list, Google Sheets export, diagnostics, and documentation.

**In `includes/class-membership-fees.php`:**

1. Add a new public method `is_former_member_in_season()` that determines if a former member should be included in the fee list for a given season:
   ```php
   public function is_former_member_in_season( int $person_id, ?string $season = null ): bool
   ```
   - Check if person has `former_member` field set to true (use `get_field('former_member', $person_id) == true` for loose comparison, same pattern as phase 168).
   - If not a former member, return false (this method is only for former members).
   - Get the person's `lid-sinds` field value.
   - If `lid-sinds` is empty/null, return false (cannot determine season eligibility without membership date).
   - Parse the season start date: extract first 4 digits of season key, build `YYYY-07-01`.
   - The member qualifies if their `lid-sinds` date falls WITHIN the season (>= season start date July 1 AND < next season start date July 1 of season_end_year). This means they joined during the current season.
   - IMPORTANT: Members who joined BEFORE the season start should NOT be included as former members in the fee list. They were already members at season start and left during the season - these members DO qualify. Wait - re-reading the requirements:
     - FEE-01: "Former members included in fee list if they have a `lid-sinds` in the current season" - This means lid-sinds falls within the current season dates.
     - Success criterion 3: "Former members who joined after season start are excluded" - Wait, this contradicts FEE-01. Let me re-read...

   Actually, re-reading more carefully:
   - SC1: "Former members with lid-sinds in current season appear in contributie list" - lid-sinds IN current season means the date is within the season range.
   - SC3: "Former members who joined after season start are excluded" - This seems to contradict SC1.

   The intent is: Former members who were ACTIVE during the season should appear. The `lid-sinds` field represents when they became a member (joined date from Sportlink). A former member should be in the fee list if they were a member at any point during the season. The simplest check: if `lid-sinds` < season END date (next July 1), they were a member during the season. But we also need to exclude members who only joined after the season is over, which is already handled by the date check.

   CORRECT INTERPRETATION based on all criteria together:
   - A former member should appear in the fee list if their `lid-sinds` is BEFORE the season end (they joined before the season ended, so they were active during it).
   - Since lid-sinds is the JOIN date, a member who joined before the season started was active for the full season. A member who joined mid-season was active for part of it. Either way, they should be on the list.
   - SC3 "joined after season start are excluded" likely refers to members who joined AFTER the season END (i.e., next season), or more precisely, it's about which members with a lid-sinds fall outside the season range.

   SIMPLEST correct logic: A former member qualifies for the fee list if their `lid-sinds` date is BEFORE the end of the season (< July 1 of season_end_year). This covers both:
   - Members who joined before season start and left during it (full fee)
   - Members who joined during the season and left during it (full fee per FEE-02, no pro-rata)

   Implementation:
   ```php
   $season = $season ?? $this->get_season_key();
   $season_end_year = (int) substr($season, 5, 4);
   $season_end_date = strtotime($season_end_year . '-07-01');
   $lid_sinds_ts = strtotime($lid_sinds);
   return ($lid_sinds_ts !== false && $lid_sinds_ts < $season_end_date);
   ```

2. Modify `calculate_full_fee()` to accept an optional `$is_former_member` parameter (default false). When true, override `prorata_percentage` to 1.0 (full fee, no pro-rata). This implements FEE-02: former members who left mid-season pay full season fee.

   Add the parameter:
   ```php
   public function calculate_full_fee( int $person_id, ?string $registration_date = null, ?string $season = null, bool $is_former_member = false ): ?array
   ```

   After calculating pro-rata, if `$is_former_member` is true, override:
   ```php
   if ( $is_former_member ) {
       $prorata_percentage = 1.0;
       $prorata_amount = $fee_after_discount; // full amount, no pro-rata reduction
   }
   ```

   Also add `'is_former_member' => $is_former_member` to the returned array for diagnostics.

3. Modify `get_fee_for_person_cached()` to check former member status and pass it through. Add former member check:
   ```php
   $is_former = ( get_field( 'former_member', $person_id ) == true );
   ```
   Pass `$is_former` as the 4th argument to `calculate_full_fee()`. Also include `'is_former_member' => $is_former` in the return data.

4. Modify `get_calculation_status()` to include former member information in diagnostics:
   - Add `'is_former_member'` boolean to the returned array.
   - Add `'former_member_in_season'` boolean to indicate if former member qualifies for season.
   - If former member and not in season, set reason to `'former_member_not_in_season'`.

5. Modify `build_family_groups()` to exclude former members who are NOT eligible for the current season's fee list. Before calculating fee for each person, check:
   ```php
   $is_former = ( get_field( 'former_member', $person_id ) == true );
   if ( $is_former && ! $this->is_former_member_in_season( $person_id, $season ) ) {
       continue; // Skip former members not in this season
   }
   ```
   This prevents former members from incorrectly affecting family discount calculations.

**In `includes/class-rest-api.php`:**

6. Modify `get_fee_list()` (around line 2948-2987): In the foreach loop over query results, add former member handling BEFORE the fee calculation:
   ```php
   $is_former = ( get_field( 'former_member', $person->ID ) == true );

   // Former members: only include if they have lid-sinds in current season
   if ( $is_former && ! $fees->is_former_member_in_season( $person->ID, $season ) ) {
       continue;
   }
   ```

   Also add `'is_former_member'` to the result array for each member:
   ```php
   'is_former_member' => $is_former,
   ```

   For the forecast path: former members should be EXCLUDED from forecast entirely (they won't be members next season). Add a check:
   ```php
   if ( $forecast && $is_former ) {
       continue; // Former members excluded from forecast
   }
   ```

7. Modify `get_person_fee()` (around line 3065): Add `'is_former_member'` to the response. Also, if the person is a former member not in the requested season, return a specific message:
   ```php
   $is_former = ( get_field( 'former_member', $person->ID ) == true );
   if ( $is_former && ! $fees->is_former_member_in_season( $person_id, $season ) ) {
       return rest_ensure_response([
           'person_id'  => $person_id,
           'season'     => $season,
           'calculable' => false,
           'is_former_member' => true,
           'message'    => 'Oud-lid valt niet binnen dit seizoen.',
       ]);
   }
   ```
   Add `'is_former_member' => $is_former` to the successful response array.

**In `includes/class-rest-google-sheets.php`:**

8. Modify `fetch_fee_data()` (around line 876): Add the same former member filtering as the REST API fee list. Before calculating fees:
   ```php
   $is_former = ( get_field( 'former_member', $person->ID ) == true );

   // Former members: only include if in current season, exclude from forecast
   if ( $is_former ) {
       if ( $forecast || ! $fees->is_former_member_in_season( $person->ID, $season ) ) {
           continue;
       }
   }
   ```
   Also add `'is_former_member'` to the result data if it's included in the export.

**In `includes/class-fee-cache-invalidator.php`:**

9. Add a hook for `former_member` field changes to invalidate the fee cache:
   ```php
   add_filter( 'acf/update_value/name=former_member', [ $this, 'invalidate_person_cache' ], 10, 3 );
   ```
   This ensures that when rondo-sync marks a member as former, their fee cache is cleared and recalculated with the new former member logic.

Run `npm run build` to ensure no PHP syntax errors break the build process. Verify that `includes/class-membership-fees.php` contains the new `is_former_member_in_season` method. Verify that `includes/class-rest-api.php` contains `is_former_member` in the fee list response. Verify that `includes/class-fee-cache-invalidator.php` has the new `former_member` hook. Deploy to production with `bin/deploy.sh` and verify the fee list endpoint returns data.

  <done>
Fee calculation engine correctly handles former members: eligible former members (lid-sinds before season end) appear in fee list with full season fee (no pro-rata), ineligible former members are excluded, family discount calculation excludes ineligible former members, Google Sheets export applies same rules, and cache invalidation triggers on former_member field changes.
