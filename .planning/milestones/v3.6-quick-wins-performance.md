# Milestone v3.6: Quick Wins & Performance

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-14
**Phases:** 40-41
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Small UX improvements (awaiting checkbox, email normalization) and bundle size optimization to restore initial load performance.

## Phases

### Phase 40: Quick Wins

**Goal**: Add awaiting checkbox toggle to todo lists, auto-lowercase emails on save
**Depends on**: v3.5 complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 40-01: Awaiting checkbox + email lowercasing

**Details:**
- Added clickable checkbox to awaiting todos in Dashboard that marks them as complete
- Email addresses in contact_info are automatically lowercased on save
- Works for both person and company post types

### Phase 41: Bundle Optimization

**Goal**: Analyze current bundle sizes and optimize (grown since v2.5)
**Depends on**: Phase 40
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 41-01: Modal lazy loading (main bundle 460 KB → 50 KB)

**Details:**
- Converted four modal imports to React.lazy with Suspense
- Main bundle reduced from 460.83 KB to 49.53 KB (89% reduction)
- TipTap editor (~370 KB) now only loads when opening modals
- Initial page load reduced from ~767 KB to ~400 KB total

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Direct completion for awaiting todos (no modal like open todos)
- Use is_email() WordPress function for email validation before lowercasing
- Used null fallback for Suspense (modals overlay content, no spinner needed)
- Lazy load all four modals together to keep pattern consistent

**Issues Resolved:**
- Bundle bloat from v3.3 TipTap introduction (460 KB main bundle → 50 KB)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
