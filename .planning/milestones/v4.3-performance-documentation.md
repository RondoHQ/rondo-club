# Milestone v4.3: Performance & Documentation

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 61-63 (including 62.1 inserted)
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

Optimize React frontend performance and complete installation documentation. This milestone also addressed an urgent need for WordPress Coding Standards compliance, resulting in a major code quality improvement across the entire PHP codebase.

## Phases

### Phase 61: React Performance Review

**Goal**: Use react-best-practices skill to analyze and optimize the frontend
**Depends on**: Previous milestone complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 61-01: React Performance Review (no code changes needed)

**Details:**
Applied 40+ performance rules across 8 categories (Eliminating Waterfalls, Bundle Size, Server-Side, Client-Side Data Fetching, Re-render Optimization, Rendering Performance, JavaScript Performance, Advanced Patterns). Codebase already follows modern React best practices with route-based code splitting, TanStack Query for data fetching, lazy state initialization, and proper memoization. **No changes required.**

### Phase 62: Installation Documentation

**Goal**: Add wp-config.php constants to README.md
**Depends on**: Phase 61
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 62-01: Add Configuration section to README.md (2/2 tasks)

**Details:**
Added complete Configuration section to README.md documenting all 6 wp-config.php constants (encryption key, Slack, Google Calendar, CalDAV). Includes reference table, step-by-step OAuth setup guides, and example snippet.

### Phase 62.1: WordPress Coding Standards (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Install WPCS and make all PHP code adhere to WordPress coding standards
**Depends on**: Phase 62
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 62.1-01: WPCS Installation & Auto-Fix (3/3 tasks) - 97.7% violations auto-fixed
- [x] 62.1-02: Manual Fixes (3/3 tasks) - 79% additional reduction, strategic exclusions

**Details:**
Installed WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS 3.3) via Composer with auto-registration. Created phpcs.xml.dist with WordPress-Extra standard and project-specific settings. Applied phpcbf auto-fixes to 53 PHP files, reducing violations from 49,450 to 238 (99.5% reduction). Added strategic exclusions for legitimate patterns (short ternary, role checks, deprecated functions). Fixed text domain (personal-crm → stadion), date() → gmdate(), and Yoda conditions in key files.

### Phase 63: PHPCS Config Refinement

**Goal**: Disable Yoda conditions rule and require short array syntax
**Depends on**: Phase 62.1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 63-01: Disable Yoda and enforce short array syntax (3/3 tasks)

**Details:**
Disabled WordPress.PHP.YodaConditions rule (prefer `$var === 'value'` over `'value' === $var`). Added Generic.Arrays.DisallowLongArraySyntax to enforce modern `[]` syntax. Converted 2,257 `array()` calls to `[]` across 47 files via phpcbf. Final PHPCS errors reduced to 46 (intentional exclusions documented).

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 62.1: WordPress Coding Standards (inserted after Phase 62 for urgent code quality improvement)

**Key Decisions:**
- WordPress-Extra standard chosen over WordPress-Core (stricter, includes best practices)
- Yoda conditions disabled for improved readability ($var === 'value' style)
- Short array syntax enforced as modern PHP convention ([] instead of array())
- Strategic exclusions for CardDAV/Sabre variable naming (interface compliance)
- No React changes needed — codebase already well-optimized

**Issues Resolved:**
- PHPCS violations reduced from 49,450 to 46 (99.9% reduction)
- Installation documentation completed for all integrations
- React performance validated against industry best practices

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- 46 remaining PHPCS violations are intentional (documented exclusions)
- 237 PHPCS warnings remain (error_log for debugging, loose comparisons in specific contexts)
