# Requirements: Rondo Club v23.0 Former Members

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** Club administrators can manage their members, teams, and important dates through a single integrated system

## v23.0 Requirements

Requirements for the former members milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Data Model

- [x] **DATA-01**: Person records have a `former_member` status field (boolean, default false) — Phase 166
- [x] **DATA-02**: Former member status is settable via REST API (`PATCH /wp/v2/person/{id}`) — Phase 166

### Sync Integration

- [x] **SYNC-01**: REST API accepts `former_member` field updates from rondo-sync — Phase 166
- [x] **SYNC-02**: API documentation updated for the former member marking endpoint — Phase 166

### Leden List

- [x] **LIST-01**: Leden list excludes former members by default — Phase 167
- [x] **LIST-02**: Filter toggle "Toon oud-leden" shows former members (with visual distinction) — Phase 168

### Dashboard

- [x] **DASH-01**: Dashboard member count excludes former members — Phase 167

### Search

- [x] **SRCH-01**: Global search includes former members with visual "oud-lid" indicator — Phase 168

### Teams

- [x] **TEAM-01**: Team rosters exclude former members from player/staff lists — Phase 167

### Contributie

- [x] **FEE-01**: Former members included in fee list if they have a `lid-sinds` in the current season — Phase 169
- [x] **FEE-02**: Pro-rata does NOT apply for former members who left during the season (full season fee) — Phase 169

## Future Requirements

None identified.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Manual marking in UI | Former member status is set by rondo-sync, not by admins in the UI |
| Separate "Oud-leden" navigation page | Filter toggle on Leden list is sufficient |
| Automatic data cleanup/purging | All data is preserved indefinitely |
| Former member notifications | No need to notify about archival |

## Traceability
