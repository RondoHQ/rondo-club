# Milestone v10.0: Read-Only UI for Sportlink Data

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 116-118
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

This milestone restricts UI editing capabilities for Sportlink-managed data while preserving full REST API functionality for automation and sync. The work covers person edit restrictions, organization creation restrictions, and custom field edit control across three focused phases.

## Phases

### Phase 116: Person Edit Restrictions

**Goal**: Users cannot delete, add addresses, or edit work history for persons in the UI
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v10.0)
**Requirements**: PERSON-01, PERSON-02, PERSON-03, PERSON-04
**Constraint**: API-01 (all REST API functionality remains unchanged)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 116-01-PLAN.md — Remove delete, address, and work history editing from PersonDetail

**Details:**
- Removed "Verwijderen" (delete) button from PersonDetail header
- Removed "Adres toevoegen" button and address edit/delete controls
- Removed "Functie toevoegen" button and work history edit controls
- Cleaned up unused imports, state, and handlers
- 257 lines removed, net reduction of 247 lines

### Phase 117: Organization Creation Restrictions

**Goal**: Users cannot create new teams or commissies in the UI
**Depends on**: Phase 116
**Requirements**: ORG-01, ORG-02
**Constraint**: API-01 (all REST API functionality remains unchanged)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 117-01-PLAN.md — Remove organization creation controls from TeamsList and CommissiesList

**Details:**
- Removed "Nieuw team" button from TeamsList header and empty state
- Removed "Nieuwe commissie" button from CommissiesList header and empty state
- Updated empty states to "wordt via de API of data import toegevoegd"
- Removed team creation from Layout.jsx quick-add menu
- Cleaned up unused creation-related imports, state, and handlers

### Phase 118: Custom Field Edit Control

**Goal**: Custom fields can be marked as non-editable in UI while remaining API-accessible
**Depends on**: Phase 117
**Requirements**: FIELD-01, FIELD-02
**Constraint**: API-01 (all REST API functionality remains unchanged)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 118-01-PLAN.md — Add editable_in_ui property to backend, settings UI, and display components

**Details:**
- Added `editable_in_ui` property to custom fields backend (Manager + REST API)
- Added "Bewerkbaar in UI" checkbox toggle in field settings form
- Conditional edit button visibility based on whether any fields are editable
- Read-only display with Lock icon and "Wordt beheerd via API" message

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Restrict UI not API (Rationale: Sportlink sync and automation need programmatic access)
- Decision: Complete removal rather than conditional hiding (Rationale: Cleaner code, no feature flags)
- Decision: Default editable_in_ui to true (Rationale: Backward compatibility with existing fields)
- Decision: Lock icon with explanation text (Rationale: Clear communication for API-managed fields)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Manual editing of Sportlink-synced data blocked in UI
- Custom fields can now be admin-marked as API-only

**Issues Deferred:**

None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None.
