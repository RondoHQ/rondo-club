## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Set for selectedIds for O(1) add/delete/has operations
- Permission check validates ownership of ALL posts before making any updates
- Used refetchQueries instead of invalidateQueries for immediate UI refresh
- Modals defined inline in PeopleList.jsx (simple enough, avoids prop drilling)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed workspace column not refreshing immediately after bulk update

**Issues Deferred:**
- ISS-001: Add sorting by Team and Workspace columns
- ISS-002: Add Label column to list view with sorting
- ISS-003: Extend bulk edit to support Teams and Labels
- ISS-004: Click table headers to change sorting
- ISS-005: Sticky table header and action bar

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
