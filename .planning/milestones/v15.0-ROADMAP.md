# Milestone v15.0: Personal Tasks

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 139-140
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Transform the task system from shared visibility to personal isolation. Each user will only see tasks they created, while maintaining the multi-person linking capability for context. Backend filtering ensures data isolation, migration preserves existing ownership, and frontend messaging makes the personal nature clear.

## Phases

### Phase 139: Backend & Migration

**Goal**: Tasks are filtered by creator across all API endpoints; existing tasks have correct ownership
**Depends on**: v14.0 complete (Phase 138)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 139-01-PLAN.md — Backend task filtering and WP-CLI migration command

**Details:**
- Added author filtering to AccessControl for stadion_todo in filter_queries() and filter_rest_query()
- Updated dashboard todo counts to filter by current user with direct SQL queries
- Created WP-CLI command for task ownership verification (`wp stadion tasks verify_ownership`)
- Fixed suppress_filters issue in get_posts() calls to ensure access control applies

### Phase 140: Frontend Messaging

**Goal**: Users understand tasks are personal through clear UI messaging
**Depends on**: Phase 139
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 140-01-PLAN.md — Frontend personal task indicators (navigation + info messages)

**Details:**
- Removed capability gating from Tasks navigation item
- Added persistent info message to TodosList page with Dutch text
- Added compact info message to GlobalTodoModal for task creation context

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed suppress_filters bypass in get_posts() that prevented access control from applying

**Issues Deferred:**
None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None
