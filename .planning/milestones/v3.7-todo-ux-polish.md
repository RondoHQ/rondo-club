# Milestone v3.7: Todo UX Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-15
**Phases:** 42
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Improve todo interaction patterns for faster, more intuitive task management. Dashboard todo clicks open a modal instead of navigating away, existing todos open in view-first mode with rendered notes, and new todos default to tomorrow's date.

## Phases

### Phase 42: Todo UX Polish

**Goal**: Dashboard todo click behavior, notes read-only mode, smart due date defaults
**Depends on**: Previous milestone complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 42-01: Todo UX Polish (Dashboard modal, view-first mode, tomorrow default)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- View mode shows HTML notes with dangerouslySetInnerHTML (safe since content is from RichTextEditor)

- Tomorrow as default date balances task urgency with realistic planning

**Issues Resolved:**
- None (clean implementation)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None
