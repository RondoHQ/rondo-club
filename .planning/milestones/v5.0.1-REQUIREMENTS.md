# Requirements: Stadion v5.0.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-18
**Core Value:** Polish dashboard meeting cards for better visual clarity and consistency

## v5.0.1 Requirements

### Meeting Card Display

- [x] **MEET-03**: Event times display in 24h format instead of 12h AM/PM
- [x] **MEET-04**: Existing synced events have `&amp;` decoded to `&` in titles (data cleanup)
