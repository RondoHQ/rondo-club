**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 86
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Polish dashboard meeting cards for better visual clarity and consistency. Time-based styling for past/current/upcoming events, 24h format, and data cleanup for HTML-encoded titles.

## Phases

### Phase 86: Meeting Card Polish

**Goal**: Improve dashboard meeting card visual clarity with time-based styling and data cleanup

**Depends on**: Phase 79 (Calendar Integration)

**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 86-01: Meeting card styling and data cleanup

**Details:**

**Requirements covered:**
- MEET-01: Past events display with dimmed/muted styling
- MEET-02: Currently active event is visually highlighted
- MEET-03: Event times display in 24h format
- MEET-04: Existing synced events have `&amp;` decoded to `&`

**Success criteria:**
1. Past events (end time < now) appear dimmed compared to upcoming events
2. Current event (start < now < end) has distinct highlight styling
3. All meeting times show 24h format (e.g., "14:30" not "2:30 PM")
4. Running data cleanup updates existing event titles with proper `&` character
5. All changes work correctly in both light and dark mode

**Implementation notes:**
- Frontend: React component styling changes in MeetingCard (Dashboard.jsx)
- Backend: WP-CLI command `wp prm event cleanup-titles` for data cleanup
- No API changes needed
