## Key Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 16 | Image column has no header label | Cleaner appearance, column is narrow |
| 16 | Star icon stays with first name | Logical grouping of name + favorite indicator |
| 17 | Copied SortableHeader pattern | Keeps files self-contained, pattern is small |
| 17 | Labels fetched via separate query | Needed to map label IDs to display names |
| 18 | Copied modal patterns inline | Consistent with PeopleList approach |
| 18 | Used team_label taxonomy | Correct taxonomy for team labels |
