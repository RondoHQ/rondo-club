# Requirements: Rondo Club

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Club administrators can manage their members, teams, and important dates through a single integrated system

## v24.0 Requirements

Requirements for Demo Data milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Export

- [x] **EXPORT-01**: User can run `wp rondo demo export` to create an anonymized fixture file from current data — Phase 171
- [x] **EXPORT-02**: Exported persons have Dutch fake names (first, infix, last), fake emails, fake Dutch phones, and fake Dutch addresses instead of real PII — Phase 172
- [x] **EXPORT-03**: Exported data includes all entity types: people, teams/commissies, discipline cases, tasks, activities/notes — Phase 171
- [x] **EXPORT-04**: All photos and avatars are excluded from the export — Phase 172
- [x] **EXPORT-05**: Financial amounts (Nikki data) are replaced with plausible fake values — Phase 172
- [x] **EXPORT-06**: Team and commissie names are preserved unchanged — Phase 171
- [x] **EXPORT-07**: All relationships between entities are preserved (person-team links, discipline case-person links, task-person links) — Phase 171
- [x] **EXPORT-08**: Settings data (fee categories, role config, family discount config) is included in the export — Phase 171

### Import

- [x] **IMP-01**: User can run `wp rondo demo import` to load fixture into a target instance — Phase 173
- [x] **IMP-02**: All dates are shifted relative to today so the demo always looks current (recent activities, upcoming birthdays, etc.) — Phase 173
- [x] **IMP-03**: User can run `wp rondo demo import --clean` to wipe existing demo data before importing — Phase 173
- [x] **IMP-04**: After import, all Rondo Club pages render correctly with demo data (leden, teams, contributie, tuchtzaken, tasks, dashboard) — Phase 174

### Fixture

- [x] **FIX-01**: The fixture is a JSON file committed to the repository — Phase 170
- [x] **FIX-02**: The fixture is self-contained — importing requires no external connections or services — Phase 170

## Future Requirements

None — this is a self-contained tooling milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Calendar events in demo | OAuth-bound, per-user — too complex for fixture |
| Google Contacts sync data | OAuth-bound, per-user |
| User account creation | Users are created separately via WordPress |
| CardDAV sync data | Per-user connection |
| Automated refresh of fixture | Manual re-export when production data changes significantly |
| Multi-locale support | Dutch only, matching the club context |
