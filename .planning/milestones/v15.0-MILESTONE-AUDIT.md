# Milestone Audit: v15.0 Personal Tasks

**Milestone:** v15.0 Personal Tasks
**Audited:** 2026-02-04T22:00:00Z
**Status:** PASSED

## Summary

Milestone v15.0 transforms the task system from shared visibility to personal isolation. Each user only sees tasks they created, while maintaining the multi-person linking capability for context. Backend filtering ensures data isolation, and frontend messaging makes the personal nature clear to users.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 10/10 | All TASK-* and UX-* requirements satisfied |
| Phases | 2/2 | Both phases verified and passed |
| Integration | 8/8 | All cross-phase connections wired |
| E2E Flows | 3/3 | All user flows work end-to-end |

## Phase Verification Summary

### Phase 139: Backend & Migration
**Status:** PASSED (7/7 truths verified)
**Goal:** Tasks are filtered by creator across all API endpoints; existing tasks have correct ownership

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| TASK-01: User only sees tasks they created in Tasks list page | ✓ SATISFIED |
| TASK-02: User only sees own tasks in PersonDetail sidebar | ✓ SATISFIED |
| TASK-03: User only sees own tasks in GlobalTodoModal | ✓ SATISFIED |
| TASK-04: Dashboard open todos count reflects only user's tasks | ✓ SATISFIED |
| TASK-05: Dashboard awaiting todos count reflects only user's tasks | ✓ SATISFIED |
| MIG-01: Existing tasks assigned to their original post_author | ✓ SATISFIED |
| MIG-02: WP-CLI migration command to verify/fix task ownership | ✓ SATISFIED |

### Phase 140: Frontend Messaging
**Status:** PASSED (3/3 truths verified, re-verified after gap closure)
**Goal:** Users understand tasks are personal through clear UI messaging

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| UX-01: Tasks navigation visible to all users | ✓ SATISFIED |
| UX-02: Persistent note in Tasks UI indicating tasks are personal | ✓ SATISFIED |
| UX-03: Note displayed when creating a new task | ✓ SATISFIED |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Wiring Verification

| Connection | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Author filter (WP_Query) → TodosList | CONNECTED | `filter_queries()` sets author param for stadion_todo |
| Author filter (REST) → TodosList | CONNECTED | `filter_rest_query()` sets author param |
| Dashboard counts → StatsRow | CONNECTED | Both count methods include `post_author` filter |
| Timeline todos → PersonDetail sidebar | CONNECTED | Timeline uses `get_posts()` which triggers access control |
| Navigation item → Route | CONNECTED | No capability gate, no route guard |
| Info message → TodosList | CONNECTED | Blue info box present |
| Info message → GlobalTodoModal | CONNECTED | Blue info box present |
| WP-CLI command → Registered | CONNECTED | `wp stadion tasks verify-ownership` available |

**Integration Score:** 8/8 connections verified

#### Flow 3: Dashboard Counts
User checks dashboard → sees only their task counts
**Status:** COMPLETE

| Step | Component | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|

**E2E Flow Score:** 3/3 flows complete

## Gaps

**No gaps found.** All requirements satisfied, all integrations wired, all flows complete.

## Tech Debt

**No tech debt accumulated.** Clean implementation with:
- No TODO/FIXME comments in modified files
- No placeholder implementations
- No anti-patterns detected

## Artifacts Created

### Phase 139
- `includes/class-access-control.php` - Author filtering for stadion_todo queries
- `includes/class-rest-api.php` - User-filtered dashboard todo counts
- `includes/class-wp-cli.php` - Task ownership verification command

### Phase 140
- `src/components/layout/Layout.jsx` - Navigation without capability gating
- `src/pages/Todos/TodosList.jsx` - Personal tasks info message
- `src/components/Timeline/GlobalTodoModal.jsx` - Personal tasks info message in modal
- `src/router.jsx` - Route accessible to all users

## Conclusion

Milestone v15.0 Personal Tasks is **COMPLETE**. All 10 requirements are satisfied, both phases pass verification, all cross-phase integrations are properly wired, and all E2E user flows work correctly.

The milestone successfully:
1. Isolates task visibility to the creator at the backend level
2. Provides clear UI messaging that tasks are personal
3. Ensures all users can access the Tasks page
4. Maintains dashboard count accuracy per user
