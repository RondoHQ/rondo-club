## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Inline popup over modal for attendee addition (reduces friction)
- Case-insensitive duplicate email detection
- Date parameter uses YYYY-MM-DD format with regex validation
- useTodayMeetings refactored to call useDateMeetings internally for backward compatibility
- Lazy loading for PersonEditModal to avoid chunk size increase
- prefillData prop pattern for pre-filling PersonEditModal from external context
- Preserve required ACF fields (first_name, last_name) when updating contact_info

**Issues Resolved:**

- Fixed HTML entity encoding (&amp;) in calendar event titles (sanitize_text_field removed)
- Fixed ACF validation error when adding email to existing person
- Increased search popup height for better usability

**Issues Deferred:**

- NAV-04: Week view option for meetings widget (v2 requirement)
- ADD-05: Batch add all unknown attendees at once (v2 requirement)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None
