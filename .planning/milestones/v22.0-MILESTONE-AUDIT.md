## Cross-Phase Integration

| Integration Point | From | To | Status |
|-------------------|------|----|--------|
| Brand tokens → Component classes | Phase 162 | Phase 164 | CONNECTED |
| Accent removal → Brand adoption | Phase 163 | Phase 164 | CONNECTED |
| Component styling → PWA branding | Phase 164 | Phase 165 | CONNECTED |
| Dark mode hook → Settings UI | Phase 163 | Settings.jsx | CONNECTED |
| Build system → CSS output | Phase 162 | Production | CONNECTED |
| Token → Utility → Component → JSX | Phase 162 | Phase 164 | CONNECTED |
| Settings → localStorage → DOM | Phase 163 | useTheme.js | CONNECTED |
| Vite config → manifest → PHP meta | Phase 162 | Phase 165 | CONNECTED |

**0 orphaned exports, 0 missing connections.**

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Brand color: token → component → browser | COMPLETE | OKLCH tokens → Tailwind utilities → CSS output |
| Dark mode: Settings → localStorage → DOM | COMPLETE | No API calls, purely client-side |
| Build: CSS-first → Vite → production bundle | COMPLETE | npm run build exit 0, all assets generated |
| Login page: PHP → brand constants → CSS | COMPLETE | 7 undefined vars fixed, brand_color_* applied |
| Settings: no accent picker, scheme only | COMPLETE | react-colorful removed, useTheme simplified |
| PWA: manifest → theme_color → mobile chrome | COMPLETE | #0891b2 in manifest and meta tags |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Pre-existing (not introduced by v22.0)

- **140 lint problems** (113 errors, 27 warnings) in JSX files — should be addressed in separate cleanup

### Introduced by v22.0 (non-critical)

- **Duplicated .btn styles** in each button variant due to Tailwind v4 @apply restriction — acceptable trade-off
- **Montserrat font files ~250 KB** — could subset further if bundle size becomes concern
- **Orphaned DB records** — rondo_accent_color option and user meta still in database (harmless, no runtime impact)

### Total: 4 items, 0 critical blockers

## Human Verification Items

From Phase 165 VERIFICATION.md:
1. Login page visual appearance on production server
2. PWA manifest theme color in mobile browser chrome

From Phase 164 VERIFICATION.md:
1. Gradient text visual quality in light and dark mode
2. Button hover lift animation feel
3. Input focus glow ring visibility
4. Card gradient border rendering at rounded corners
5. Dark mode brand color cohesion

## Conclusion

All 19 requirements satisfied. All 4 phases verified with automated checks. Cross-phase integration fully connected with no orphaned code or broken flows. Accent color system completely removed. Dark mode adapted to brand colors. Build pipeline operational.

**Status: PASSED** — Ready for milestone completion.
